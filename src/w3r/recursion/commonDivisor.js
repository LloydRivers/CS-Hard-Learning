2. Write a JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive numbers using recursion.  


Step 1: Find the product of a and b. 
Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b. 
Step 3: Divide the product by LCM. Step 4: The obtained value is the greatest common divisor of (a, b).
